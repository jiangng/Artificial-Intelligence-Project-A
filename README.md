# Artificial-Intelligence-Project-A

This is the first groupwork project I did when taking the 3rd-year subject Artificial Intelligence at The University of Melbourne. This project was based on a board game invented by the head tutor known as Watch Your Back. Our task was to write a Python 3.6 program that reads a text-based board configuration from input,
and calculates the number of available moves for each player and a sequence of moves for White pieces that would eliminate all Black pieces assuming the Black pieces are unable to move. Overall we did a satisfactory work, scoring 6.75 out of 8 marks. One improvement we could have done is use object-oriented programming instead of coding everything in a single file.
